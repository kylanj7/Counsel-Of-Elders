Design a comprehensive, production-ready architecture for a globally distributed,
real-time AI-powered medical diagnosis platform that must handle the following
requirements simultaneously:
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Process 10 million concurrent patient consultations with sub-100ms latency globally
Integrate with 50,000+ hospital systems using different protocols (HL7, FHIR, proprietary APIs)
Run multiple specialized AI models (vision for medical imaging, NLP for patient records,
predictive analytics for disease progression, drug interaction checking)
Maintain 99.999% uptime with zero data loss during regional failures
Handle multi-modal inputs: text, voice (50+ languages), medical images (X-ray, MRI, CT),
real-time vital signs from IoT devices, genetic data

SECURITY & COMPLIANCE:

HIPAA, GDPR, and regional medical data regulations compliance across 150+ countries
Zero-knowledge encryption for patient data at rest and in transit
Quantum-resistant cryptography for long-term data protection
Real-time anomaly detection and automated threat response
Audit trails for every data access with 10-year retention
Air-gapped disaster recovery with RPO < 1 second

DATA CHALLENGES:

Process and correlate 50TB of new medical data per hour
Real-time analysis of streaming genomic sequences (3 billion base pairs per patient)
Federated learning across hospitals without centralizing sensitive data
Maintain data lineage and provenance for regulatory audits
Real-time data quality validation and bias detection in AI predictions

OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS:

Deploy across hybrid cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) and on-premise data centers
Cost optimization with auto-scaling that considers medical urgency levels
Carbon-neutral operations with renewable energy prioritization
Continuous deployment with A/B testing of AI models without patient risk
Automated compliance certification and reporting

QUANTUM COMPUTING INTEGRATION:

Leverage quantum computing for drug interaction simulation and molecular modeling
Hybrid classical-quantum workflows for real-time and batch processing
Error correction and noise mitigation strategies
Fallback to classical systems when quantum resources unavailable

EDGE CASES & ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

Handle contradictory AI model predictions with explainable arbitration
Prioritization algorithm for resource allocation during pandemic-scale surges
Bias mitigation across demographic groups with different baseline data availability
Graceful degradation when partial system failures occur during critical diagnoses
Human-in-the-loop protocols for high-stakes decisions
Transparency reporting for AI decision-making to patients and doctors

ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS:

System must work in low-bandwidth environments (rural hospitals, disaster zones)
Offline-first architecture for areas with unreliable connectivity
Integration with existing legacy systems (some 30+ years old)
Support for emerging technologies (AR/VR for surgical planning, brain-computer interfaces)
Regulatory approval pathway for AI model updates

YOUR TASK:
Provide a detailed architectural design addressing ALL of these requirements.
For each technical domain, discuss:

Specific technology choices and why
Trade-offs and alternative approaches
Failure modes and mitigation strategies
Performance optimization techniques
Cost-benefit analysis
Timeline and phased implementation approach

Be specific about protocols, frameworks, algorithms, and implementation details.
Consider interactions between different components and potential conflicts.
Address both the happy path and edge cases.
